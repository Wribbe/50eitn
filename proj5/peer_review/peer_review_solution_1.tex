    % Too much text will cap results, too little undefined but bad?
    % 7*0.75=5.25 NOK, consequences unclear
    % 7*1.25=8.75 OK
    % 7*1.40=9.8 NOK, will cap grade to grade 6

    \subsection{Deduction motivations}
      Here, only requirements that were not deemed fulfilled are mentioned, as to save space.
      
    	\begin{itemize}
    		\item{\textbf{A} Good.}
    		\item{\textbf{B} A very short and general description of customer base. Product use with its environment and people using it
    			is hardly specified, the one thing about this is in one assumption, A.WATCH.}
    		\item{\textbf{C} -}
    		\item{\textbf{D1} TPM is specified to use functions that require key storage, but no mention of the need to handle secret/auth values, minus 1 point.}
    		\item{\textbf{D2} TOE is not mentioned but its content is reflected in the report, minus 1 point.}
    		\item{\textbf{E1} - }
    		\item{\textbf{E2} It could be argued here that TPM is not necessary when looking at Table 1, since the only threat it mitigates is one that 
    			has two other counter-measures, minus 0.5 point. The objetive O.Sanitize is not mentioned in architectural overview, minus 0.5 point. }
    	\end{itemize}
    	
    	The length of the report's text, $\sim$ 6 pages, are inside the specified limits (7 pages * 0.75 = 5.25 pages $<$ 6 pages).
