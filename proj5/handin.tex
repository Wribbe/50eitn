    Project description:

    We have a battery driven camera device that has the following components:
    camera, PCB board with flash memory, RAM, ARM TrustZone CPU, TPM, JTAG
    debug interface, LTE subsystem with USIM card reader, and special Flash
    to hold an ID.

    The battery is connected via a power management system, see Figure 1. You
    can assume that the battery is normally connected to a charger and that
    the battery lasts for 3 days of operation or recording and transmission.

    Based on the requirements you should come up with an architecture/desing
    of the camera device that meets the security, production and maintenance
    requirements. You have to document the design and your motivations in the
    projects report. In your design you can use various features from course
    material presented thus far but you make use other insights too.

    \end{description}

    \subsection{CC evaluation types}

      There are two types of Common Criteria evaluations.

      \subsubsection{Protection profile evaluation}

        The evaluation is concerned with a set of implementation-independent
        requirements that are established for a category of similar products
        and systems. A typical protection profile includes:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item{Introduction containing a description and overview of the
            targeted system.}
          \item{Description of the products or systems in question.}
          \item{Description of the security environment in relation to the
            products or systems.}
          \item{Relevant security objectives.}
          \item{Requirements on IT security.}
          \item{Rationale behind the grouping.}
        \end{itemize}
        Example of protection profile groupings are; antivirus on workstations,
        biometrics, firewalls and intrusion detection systems.

      \subsubsection{Evaluation against a security target}
      Sources:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Target}}
        \item{\e{slides_on_cc.pdf}}
      \end{itemize}

        The security target contains a list of implementation-specific security
        requirements that should be met by the system or product in question
        together with the steps taken to meet those requirements. The document
        can also reference relevant protection profiles that are fulfilled.
         A typical security target includes:

        \begin{itemize}
          \item{Introduction of what the target does, key features and purpose.}
          \item{Description of threats and assumptions present in the
            operational environment.}
          \item{Security objectives specifying solutions to the perceived
            threats in both the target and its environment together with the
            rationale these were chosen.}
          \item{Definition of functional and assurance security requirements
            together with the reason these are sufficient and necessary.}
          \item{Target summary specification that enables readers to get a
            general understanding of how the target is structured and
            implemented. This section also provides a high-level view of how
            each security functional requirement is solved through developed
            software.}
        \end{itemize}

  \section{Product description}

    \comm{Description of product and design requirements that have been
    considered.}

    \textbf{Functional requirements:}
    \begin{checklist}
      \item{SRTP stream for data.}
      \item{Possible to update firmware of camera securely.}
      \item{Embed cryptographically strong identifier during production.}
      \item{Flash storage for configurations and recording of 60 min + loop of 60 minutes.}
      \item{Repair/Maintenance personell should not have access to stored data.}
      \item{Possible for user to wipe data on decommission.}
      \item{GUI with information about attestation, firmware, and hash of key
        that protects RTSP stream and stored video.}
      \item{Tamper sensor in camera housing.}
      \item{Possible to patch hardware errors with software and ROM path
        functionality.}
    \end{checklist}

      \comm{Product-assumptions that affect security, maintenance and production
      costs should be taken into account here.}

  \section{Architectural overview}

    \comm{%
      The first part is a short high-level architectural overview that explains
      how your design is structured.  The level of your description is the
      important focus here. Motivate your design choices. Do not go into
      insignificant details. Upon reading your architectural overview, the
      reader should clearly, correctly and quickly understand the structure of
      your system. You are required to draw an image to illustrate this
      structure (half page).

      Your main challenge here is to use your technical writing ability to
      explain technical details in a way that is easily absorbed and not so
      easily misunderstood. Keep your description at a high structural level.
      Only include details if they are important from a security perspective.
      The intended audience for this part should be a student in your program
      that has only taken the Basic Computer Security course. Upon reading your
      description, the reader should understand the structure and main points
      of your protection system.

      This part should contain your Target Of Evaluation (TOE) and Security
      Target (ST). Here you can be informal and not follow the Common Criteria
      style of naming.
    }


    \todo{2-3 pages}

  \section{Security evaluation}

  \textbf{Threats to consider:}
  \begin{checklist}
    \item{Avoid bugs in the (remote) management that would allow someone to
      insert executable foreign code.}
    \item{Should not be possible to load unauthorized firmware.}
    \item{Don't allow loading of SRTP keys for a incorrect receiver.}
    \item{Include safeguards concerning removing flash memory and loading it
      with altered configurations or code.}
    \item{Deploy routines that circumvents dishonest repair personnel.}
    \item{Secure JTAG debug interface against misuse.}
    \item{Mitigate damage due to lost key or camera.}
  \end{checklist}

  \comm{%
    The second part is a short Security evaluation of your design that explains
    what types of protection you use and why. The list of security
    consideration should list all attack types and major security issues you
    can think of and explain if, why and/or how it is or is not applicable to
    your system.  For each attack/issue, explain clearly and concisely what you
    have done to protect your solution.  Or briefly explain why no protection
    is needed. Your report should clearly contain a description that gives the
    motives of your security related design choices.

    Do not forget the consequences for design choices for the manufacturing and
    repair costs.  Your evaluation should contain a table which row wise lists
    the threats that you considered and
