      \subsubsection{Security features}

    \subsubsection{Security assumptions}

       \begin{itemize}
         \assumption{LOCATION}{Mounting place}{The camera is designed to be mounted on outside of building of a tech company.}
         \assumption{CORRECT\_CONFIG}{Correct configuration}{It is assumed that SRTP is used and that authentication and encryption in it are enabled.}
         \assumption{TIMELY\_MAINT}{Maintenance schedule followed}{It is assumed that maintenance personnel follows the maintenance schedule
         and that no deterioration of product due to neglected maintenance occurs.}
         \assumption{QA}{Quality Assurance}{No more than 0.5\% of units are shipped with faulty components.}
       \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Threats}
      \begin{itemize}[label={}]
        \threat{PHYSICAL}{Physical Access} {
          An attacker can physically access the camera. This can result in
          destruction of camera in pure vandalizing, removal of camera from
          premises opening up for other threats (T.X and T.Y), covering camera
          with other physical object or smearing something on camera
          housing/lens rendering recorded video useless.
        }
        \threat{NETWORK}{Network attack} {
          Since the camera is outfitted with a 4G subsystem, attacks relevant for
          such a system are relevant here.
          \\ Note: Go all the way as teacher's pets and specify that object
          security should be used?
        }
        \threat{MISMANAGE}{Incompetent personnel} {
          There is a risk that the persons managing and servicing the camera do
          not have the skills required, which can result in password being
          leaked, physical components of camera damaged, camera not mounted on
          wall correctly etc.
        }
        \threat{DISHONESTY}{Dishonest repair personnel}{ %please help me find better name than DISHONEST...
          The repair personnel may be dishonest and try to access the video
          files, the keys, may try to inject code or access internal memory of
          camera.
        }
        \threat{PERSISTENT}{Persistent presence}{
          If the (remote) management system is flawed an attacker could,
          besides inserting executable foreign code, access camera through the
          management interface at their convenience.
        }
        \threat{LOST\_ASSET}{Camera/key is lost}{
          An attacker either physically makes off with a camera or gets hold of
          a crypto key.
        }
        \item{
          Avoid bugs in the (remote) management that would allow someone to
          insert executable foreign code. This should be under T.NETWORK.
        }
        \item{
          Should not be possible to load unauthorized firmware.
        }
        \item{
          Don't allow loading of SRTP keys for an incorrect receiver.
        }
        \item{
          Include safeguards concerning removing flash memory and loading it
          with altered configurations or code.
        }
        \item{
          Secure JTAG debug interface against misuse. Check article about
          JTAG interface attacking from first part of course.
        }
        \item{
          From first part of course, attack where microprocessor is removed
          and is either probed or re-soldered (BGA) in order to access memory.
          Defense against this dark art? Check article again. Note: perhaps
          part of 'flash memory' entry above in this list. Or T.LOST\_ASSET.
        }
